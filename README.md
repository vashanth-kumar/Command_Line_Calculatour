# Command_Line_Calculatour
This program uses four functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to perform the basic arithmetic operations. Each function takes two arguments (x, y) and returns the result of the operation. The program also includes a simple error handling mechanism in the divide function to raise an exception if the user attempts to divide by zero.
